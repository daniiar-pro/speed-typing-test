# Typing Test 

1. Prototype of Typing Test apps like:
### https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english
### https://monkeytype.com/

## How it works
1. Basically, it fetches text in JSON format and displays on the screen for user to type
2. Allows user to test typing speed and displays test result on the UI as a Chart, and shows user's previous test results
3. Test results are saved in localStorage


## How to run
1. (https://daniiar-pro.github.io/speed-typing-test/) navigate to this link and give a try.
2. `git clone` clone the repo, in `main.js` run the app, initially there's only 10 seconds given for the test, however in `config.js` file change `set_duration` set timer as much as you want
